### Planning Artifacts

- `prd.md` — requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Do not put technical design or execution checklists here.
- `design.md` — technical design for complex tasks: boundaries, contracts, data flow, tradeoffs, compatibility, rollout / rollback shape.
- `implement.md` — execution plan for complex tasks: ordered checklist, validation commands, review gates, and rollback points.
- `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` — spec and research manifests for sub-agent context. They do not replace `implement.md`.
- Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

### Parent / Child Task Trees

Use a parent task when one user request contains several independently verifiable deliverables. The parent task owns the source requirement set, the task map, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review; it normally should not be the implementation target unless it also has direct work.

Use child tasks for deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently. Parent/child structure is not a dependency system: if one child must wait for another, write that ordering in the child `prd.md` / `implement.md` and keep each child's acceptance criteria testable.

Create new children with `task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir>`. Link existing tasks with `task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>`, and unlink mistakes with `task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>`.


## 原文 L457–L459

For lightweight tasks, `prd.md` can be enough. For complex tasks, `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` must exist and be reviewed before start. On sub-agent-dispatch platforms, `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must both have real curated entries before start. Runtime consumers tolerate missing or seed-only manifests for compatibility, but that tolerance is not a planning-ready state.

After this command succeeds, the breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:in_progress]`, and the rest of Phase 2 / 3 follows.

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running project lint and type-check
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform hook/plugin auto-handles:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects referenced spec/research files into the agent prompt
- Injects `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- For Codex, `SubagentStart` supplies native context injection; the agent profile keeps child-side loading as the fallback

- **Task description**: Review all code changes against specs and task artifacts; fix any findings directly; ensure lint and type-check pass
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-check` sub-agent and must review/fix directly, not spawn another `trellis-check` / `trellis-implement`.
- **DeepSeek Harness**: tell the child to load `trellis-agent-check` exactly once. If `trellis_wait` is available, use the default background mode, continue independent work, then wait once for that child id and consume its successful native settlement notice before Phase 3. Without `trellis_wait`, dispatch that child with `run_in_background: false`. Do not poll or sleep.

The check agent's job:
- Review code changes against specs
- Review code changes against `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- Auto-fix issues it finds
- Run lint and typecheck to verify
- A required check that cannot run, is skipped, or exits non-zero is blocked/failed, never passed. Do not weaken or rewrite acceptance criteria to advance the workflow.
